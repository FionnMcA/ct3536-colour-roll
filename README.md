# ct3536-colour-roll

Colour Roll is an endless runner game developed as part of my "CT3536 Games Programming" module. [More about CT3536](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/course-information/module/CT3536).

In the game, you control a ball that constantly changes colour after passing through tunnels. The player must navigate through tunnels of matching colours while avoiding obstacles, with the tunnel formations continuously shifting. Along the way, players collect coins for extra points and earn additional points for successfully passing through the correct tunnels. As the game progresses, the speed increases, and the challenge intensifies with more obstacles appearing.
